# tt-inference-server

`tt-inference-server` is the fastest way to deploy and test models for serving inference on Tenstorrent hardware.

## Quickstart guide

On first-run please see the [prerequisites](docs/prerequisites.md) guide for general Tenstorrent hardware and software setup.

For the specific quickstart guide and details for your model, select your model and hardware configuration in Model Support pages and tables below. Alternatively you can see all models supported for your given Tenstorrent hardware.
