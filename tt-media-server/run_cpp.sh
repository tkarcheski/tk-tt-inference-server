# Note on LD_PRELOAD removal (engine-split Phase 3c):
# The previous version preloaded ./tt-llm-engine/build-full/libtt_llm_engine.so.0
# when LLM_DEVICE_BACKEND=pipeline_manager. That path no longer exists — the
# engine .so now lives at /opt/tt-llm-engine/lib/libtt_llm_engine.so.0 (shipped
# by the prebuilt tt-llm-engine image) and is linked into tt_media_server_cpp
# via find_package (cpp_server/CMakeLists.txt) plus runtime LD_LIBRARY_PATH
# (set in Dockerfile.blaze runtime stage). There is now a single canonical
# copy of the .so, so the preload override that distinguished build-tree from
# install-tree copies is no longer needed.
